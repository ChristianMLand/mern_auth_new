# Example Project with Iron-Session
This project demonstrates how using [`iron-session`](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session/tree/main/examples/express) can greatly simplify the login/registration process while still covering all of the same core concepts. 

Although `iron-session` has the most support for `Next.js`, it supports `express` as well, so it can be used even before the `Next.js` transition.
